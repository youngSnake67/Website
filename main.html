                        <li>I have had experience in working on backend using Javascript which I gained through my COMP1531 course where me and 4 group members made a clone of kahoot.
                         This included writing tests, working on routing, making API calls and Authentication(Hashing Passwords). This was extremely valuable experience, however i was never
                         taught how to code or maintain frontend. Frontend using HTML and CSS was completely self taught since the start of 2026. I love Webdev as it allows me to express my creativity
                         and have something to show for visually which is very staisfying. This is my first project where i strung together HTML CSS and Javascript to make a website and I beleive that 
                         if given the opportunity I will be able to contribute well as a Trainee and learn the basics I may have skipped over and overall become a better web dev who has experience working in a team environment.
